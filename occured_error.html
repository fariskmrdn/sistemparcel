    <h1>DATABASE / SERVER CONNECTION COULDN'T ESTABLISHED !</h1>
    <p>This quite rarely to happen. It's either your port blocked or maybe you hopped on to the wrong server...</p>
    <p>If you're a coding master just search for the configuration file.</p>
    <p>otherwise maybe Google on the solution</p>
    <p>Contact the developer if this problem still occured !</p>
